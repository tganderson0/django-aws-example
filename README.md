# Example Django Project

This is an example repository that you can use to try setting up a web server using Apache. This assumes you have access to a computer running Ubuntu, with  >= Python 3.8. In the Apache config, the example assumes the cloned folder is renamed to `todos` rather than `django-aws-example`.

## Setting up a project

The file [steps.md](steps.md) has the instructions for setting up a Django server. This project serves as something you can use to try it out, but try your own as well!
