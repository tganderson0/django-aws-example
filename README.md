# Example Django Project

This is the backend django for my AWS example presentation. Just a basic django app that serves the todo model, but you can't update the backend state. It is truly just the bare essentials to show that there is a connection between the frontend and backend.

## Setting up a project

The file [steps.md](steps.md) has the instructions for setting up a Django server. This project serves as something you can use to try it out, but try your own as well!
